    "   * Machine learning users did find it useful, so I quickly cleaned it up and made it presentable as **Uproot 2.x**.\n",
    "   * The way people were using Uproot influenced how I thought about columnar analysis: breaking it out into smaller pieces and eventually the exposing array-at-a-time interface to users, rather than hiding the columnar processing behind a query language.\n",
    "   * Uproot's \"bottom up\" JaggedArrays were moved into a new package, **Awkward Array**, replacing the \"top down\" view of OAMap. This was **Uproot 3.x**.\n",
    "   * Awkward Array is successful even though it has interface flaws and its pure Python \"no for loops!\" implementation is hard to maintain.\n",
    "   * **Awkward 1.x** started last fall with a long development time to \"do it right.\" It is complete, but not very visible because Uproot doesn't produce the new-style arrays yet.\n",
    "   * **Uproot 4.x** started development in May with a release date of July 1.\n",
