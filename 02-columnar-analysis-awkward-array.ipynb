    "Even though I don't have formal exercises scattered throughout these notebooks, this session can still be interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **You** should open each notebook in Binder (see [GitHub README](https://github.com/jpivarski/2020-06-08-uproot-awkward-columnar-hats)) and evaluate cells, following along with me.\n",
    "   * **I** should pause frequently and stay open to questions. I'll be monitoring the videoconference chat.\n",
    "   * **We** should feel free to step off the path and try to answer \"What if?\" questions in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all digressions will lead to an answer—I often realize, \"That's why it didn't work!\" long after the tutorial is over—but tinkering is how we learn.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the first programming languages, named **APL** (\"A Programming Language\") was array-based. It started as a notation for _describing_ hand-written machine code and was later made interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nial** was also theoretically motivated, and the two of these inspired a generation of direct descendants (green).\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the **S** language for statistics borrowed many of these ideas while being focused on a particular domain. Its descendent, **R**, is still widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDL** was invented for the sciences and gained a lot of traction as an alternative to writing custom Fortran, again using vectorization as a first-class concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MATLAB** was similarly gained traction in the sciences as a commercial product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDL** (Perl Data Language) and **NumPy** introduced the same concepts as libraries within an established language (Perl and Python). **Julia** has some vector-like interfaces, though its focus is on just-in-time compiling imperative code."

    "   * Arrays are the central data type with most operations applying to arrays. (By contrast, C requires explicit iteration over the arrays: it's imperative.)\n",
    "   * They are _all_ interactive languages. The array-at-a-time logic makes it possible to define precompiled routines that run in response to user commands.\n",
